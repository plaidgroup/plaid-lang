\abstract{
Plaid is the first typestate-oriented programming language.
Typestate-oriented programming extends the object-oriented
programming paradigm so that each object has a state that
can change as a program executes.  Each state has its own
interface, behavior, and representation.  Plaid combines
a pure object model with good support for functional
programming.
\\
\\
\indent
This document defines the syntax and semantics of the
dynamically-typed core of the Plaid language.
